Data Carpentry Notes on Bash Git

#Make a git repository that will track everything above the folder
cd target folder
git init

#Never create a nested git repository!!!

#Use git status frequently to make sure things are on track
git status

#Tell Git to track files, need to items EACH time you want to commit
git add <filename>

#Commit changes with message
git commit -m "comment on what I changed"
